## Overfitting and Underfitting

Model performance is evaluated based on two factors:
- **Accuracy**: Measures how well a model predicts the correct output.
- **Generalization**: Assesses how well a model performs on new, unseen data.

### Underfitting
Underfitting occurs when a model has low accuracy on both training and test data.

### Causes
- Insufficient data
- Overly simplistic model (e.g., linear model for nonlinear data)
- Inadequate feature selection

### Underfitting Solutions
- Increase model complexity
- Feature engineering
- Gather more relevant data

### Overfitting
Overfitting happens when a model has high accuracy on training data but low accuracy on test data.

### Causes
- Overly complex model
- Training on noise or outliers
- Insufficient regularization

### Right Fit (Good Fit)
A model is considered to have a good fit when it makes predictions with minimal error and generalizes well to new data.

### Characteristics
- Balance between bias and variance
- Good performance on training data
- Good generalization to test data

### Overfitting Solutions
- Feature Selection
- Regularization (reduce size of parameters) techniques (L1, L2)
- Cross-validation
- Ensemble methods
- Early stopping in iterative algorithms

`Real-life scenario:` A weather prediction model undergoes fitting analysis. An underfit model might always predict "sunny," while an overfit model remembers specific dates instead of weather patterns. A well-fit model balances historical patterns with adaptability to new conditions.
