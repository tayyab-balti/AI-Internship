# Machine Learning from Scratch

## Overview
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions, relying instead on patterns and inference.

## How It Works

### Training Phase
1. **Input Dataset**: Collect and preprocess the data.
2. **Feed into Algorithm**: Use the data to train the machine learning model.
3. **Learn from Data**: The algorithm identifies patterns and performs classification tasks.

### Testing Phase
1. **Introduce New Dataset**: Present new, unseen data to the model.
2. **Model**: The trained model processes the new data.
3. **Build Logical Models**: Apply the learned patterns from the training phase.
4. **Apply on New Data**: Use the model to make predictions.
5. **Give Output**: Generate predictions based on the new data.


## Characteristics of Machine Learning
- **Automated Data Visualization**: Ability to automatically visualize data patterns.
- **Precise Data Analysis**: High accuracy in analyzing large datasets.
- **Business Intelligence**: Provides valuable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Pros of Machine Learning
- **Complex Problem Solving**: Effective in resolving intricate problems.
- **Automation**: Automates repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency.
- **Trend and Pattern Identification**: Identifies trends and patterns (e.g., buying habits on Amazon).
- **Wide Range of Applications**: Applicable in various fields such as medical, finance, and object detection.

## Cons of Machine Learning
- **Data Acquisition**: Requires large datasets for training.
- **Error-Prone**: Highly sensitive to incorrect or biased data.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choosing the right algorithm can be challenging.
- **Time-Consuming**: Training models can be time-intensive.
- **Additional Resources**: May require substantial computational resources.


## Classification of Machine Learning
- **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data to train algorithms (e.g., spam filtering).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Identifies patterns in unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: An agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties.


## Machine Learning Life Cycle

### Data Collection
- Gather relevant data from various sources.
- Ensure data quality and quantity.

### Data Preparation
- Clean and preprocess raw data.
- Handle missing values and outliers.

### Data Wrangling
- Transform and structure data for analysis.
- Feature engineering and selection.

### Data Modeling
- Choose appropriate ML algorithms.
- Define model architecture.

### Model Training
- Feed prepared data into the model.
- Adjust model parameters iteratively.

### Model Testing
- Evaluate model performance on unseen data.
- Fine-tune model based on results.

### Model Deployment
- Integrate model into production environment.
- Monitor and maintain model performance.


## Differences Between AI, ML, and DL

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- **Definition**: Machines mimicking human intelligence that are programmed to think and learn.
- **Applications**: Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa), autonomous vehicles, and recommendation systems.
- **Example**: Chatbots that can understand and respond to human language.

### Machine Learning (ML)
- **Definition**: AI subset where machines learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
- **Applications**: Fraud detection, spam filtering, customer segmentation.
- **Example**: Email spam filters that improve over time by learning from user actions.

### Deep Learning (DL)
- **Definition**: ML subset that uses artificial neural networks with many layers to learn and make decisions on data.
- **Applications**: Speech recognition, natural language processing, computer vision.
- **Example**: Image recognition in self-driving cars.

### Main Differences
- **AI**: The broadest concept.
- **ML**: A way to achieve AI through data-driven learning.
- **DL**: A specialized ML technique using complex neural networks.


## AI Classification

### Weak AI (Narrow AI)
- **Definition**: Designed for specific tasks.
- **Example**: Chess-playing computers.

### Strong AI (Artificial General Intelligence - AGI)
- **Definition**: Hypothetical AI with human-like consciousness.
- **Example**: Not yet achieved, often seen in science fiction.


## Data Preprocessing Steps

1. **Getting Dataset**: Obtain the dataset from relevant sources.

2. **Importing Libraries**: Load necessary Python libraries. `pandas` for data manipulation, `sklearn` for preprocessing.

3. **Importing Datasets**: Load dataset into your working environment. Using `pandas.read_csv()` to load a CSV file.

4. **Finding Missing Values**: Identify and handle incomplete data. Using `df.isnull().sum()` to count missing values.

5. **Encoding Categorical Data**: Convert text data to numerical format for machine learning algorithms. Using `sklearn's LabelEncoder` for ordinal data.

6. **Splitting Dataset**: Divide dataset into training and test sets. Using `train_test_split` from `sklearn`.

7. **Feature Scaling**: Normalize numerical features. Using `StandardScaler` from `sklearn`.


## Features & Labels
- **Features**: An independent property of the training data, typically represented by two or more columns used to make predictions in a machine learning model.
    - `Example`: Housing price predictors: bedrooms, size, location.

- **Labels**: Labels are the output variables or the target that the machine learning model aims to predict. 
    - `Example`: In a housing price prediction model, the label would be the price of the house.


## Supervised Learning

- **Goal**: Predict outcomes for new data based on labeled training data.
- **Algos**: Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM
- **Types**: 
    - **Classification**: Predict categories (classes) & small no of possible outputs.
    - **Regression**: Predict continuous outcomes (numbers) & infinitely many possible outputs.

## Unsupervised Learning
- **Goal**: Find patterns or structures in unlabeled data without any prior training of data.
- **Algos**: k-Means Clustering, Neural networks
- **Types**:
    - **Clustering**: Group similar data points.
    - **Association**: Discover rules that describe large portions of data. (Buying a laptop + laptop accessories)
