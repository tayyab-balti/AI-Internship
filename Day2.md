# Introduction

Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables.

- `Real-life scenario`: Predicting house prices based on square footage.

## Simple Linear Regression
Involves one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y).

`Formula`: Y = mX + c

- **Y**: Dependent variable
- **X**: Independent variable
- **m**: Slope (shows how much `y` changes with one-unit change in `X`)
- **c**: Y-intercept (value of `y` when `X` is 0)

- `Real-life scenario`: Estimating a person's weight (Y) based on their height (X).

## Multiple Linear Regression
Involves multiple independent variables (X1, X2, ..., Xn) and one dependent variable (Y).

`Formula`: Y = m1X1 + m2X2 + ... + bnXn + c

- `Real-life scenario`: Predicting a car's fuel efficiency based on its weight, horsepower, and age.
