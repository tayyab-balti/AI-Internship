# Machine Learning from Scratch

## Overview
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions, relying instead on patterns and inference.

## How It Works

### Training Phase
1. **Input Dataset**: Collect and preprocess the data.
2. **Feed into Algorithm**: Use the data to train the machine learning model.
3. **Learn from Data**: The algorithm identifies patterns and performs classification tasks.

### Testing Phase
1. **Introduce New Dataset**: Present new, unseen data to the model.
2. **Model**: The trained model processes the new data.
3. **Build Logical Models**: Apply the learned patterns from the training phase.
4. **Apply on New Data**: Use the model to make predictions.
5. **Give Output**: Generate predictions based on the new data.

## Characteristics of Machine Learning
- **Automated Data Visualization**: Ability to automatically visualize data patterns.
- **Precise Data Analysis**: High accuracy in analyzing large datasets.
- **Business Intelligence**: Provides valuable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Pros of Machine Learning
- **Complex Problem Solving**: Effective in resolving intricate problems.
- **Automation**: Automates repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency.
- **Trend and Pattern Identification**: Identifies trends and patterns (e.g., buying habits on Amazon).
- **Wide Range of Applications**: Applicable in various fields such as medical, finance, and object detection.

## Cons of Machine Learning
- **Data Acquisition**: Requires large datasets for training.
- **Error-Prone**: Highly sensitive to incorrect or biased data.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choosing the right algorithm can be challenging.
- **Time-Consuming**: Training models can be time-intensive.
- **Additional Resources**: May require substantial computational resources.

## Classification of Machine Learning
- **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data to train algorithms (e.g., spam filtering).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Identifies patterns in unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: An agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties.
